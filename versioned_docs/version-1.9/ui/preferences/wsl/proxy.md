### WSL Proxy

Rancher Desktop now allows local, corporate, or VPN proxy server support for Windows users. The implementation can be enabled or disabled through the `Proxy` tab to capture network traffic and forward it to an http proxy. Once all information has been input, click the `Apply` button to have changes immediately take effect.

### Proxy address

Users can input their proxy IP address and port number in the `Proxy address` fields.

### Authentication information

If your proxy requires authentication then users can input their username and password in the `Authentication information` fields.
